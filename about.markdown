Buddy Brewer leads strategic initiatives for [SOASTA mPulse](http://www.soasta.com/performance-monitoring/), a real user measurement service that tells you how long people are waiting on your site and how it is impacting their behavior. Prior to SOASTA Buddy co-founded LogNormal, the first company to put measuring real users first in the crowded space of performance monitoring tools. LogNormal was acquired by SOASTA in 2012.

Buddy has been helping some of the largest sites on the web solve their performance challenges since 2001.
