title: What CrossFit teaches you about success
---

As anyone who's spent much time around me knows, I've been doing CrossFit for
the last six months or so and I'm a huge fan for lots of reasons.

Take today's workout for example.

> ### Air Force WOD ###
> 
> For time:
> 
>  * 20 Thrusters
>  * 20 Sumo deadlift high pulls
>  * 20 Push jerks
>  * 20 Overhead squats
>  * 20 Front squats

By the way, for every minute you have the audacity to not be finished yet, you
have to stop and do four burpees. So the more you slow down, the more total
work you have to do.

At first I was convinced this was too hard for me to finish, even scaling down
from the prescribed weight of 95 lbs. With the start timer counting down its
final seconds I pictured how I would handle the embarrassment of DNF'ing. But
with three seconds to go I decided picturing failure was only making it worse,
picturing success felt like lying to myself, so I went with the only remaining
option: clear my mind, take it one rep at a time and whatever happens, happens.

Astonishingly, less than 14 minutes later I completed the final rep. Not even
close to a world class time, but infinitely better than the DNF I was stressing
about a handful of minutes ago.

But here's the really cool part: the biggest threat to success wasn't a lack of
muscular strength or endurance, it was lacking the willpower to keep going when
the work got hard, or worse - not even having the courage to try.

I thought about this for a while as I was laying on the floor waiting for my
legs to stop burning.

CrossFit can make you leaner, faster, stronger and all that, but it also
teaches you that 9 times out of 10 the battle between success and failure is
fought in your own head. And winning that battle is a trainable skill that
you can develop through practice. It's true in sports, business, and life in
general.

So next time you think something is impossible, don't give up. Clear your
mind, take it one step at a time and whatever happpens, happens. You're
capable of more than you think.
