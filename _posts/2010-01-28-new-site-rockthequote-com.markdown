Ever see a quote out of context and wonder if it was twisted to manipulate the truth?

I just put up a new web site called "<a title="Rock the Quote"
href="http://rockthequote.com">Rock the Quote</a>" aimed at solving this
problem. It's a searchable collection of speeches and remarks from Presidents
and other famous people in American politics, with an extra feature that lets
you share quotes without losing their original context. Each speech lets you
select text, highlight it, and share links with people that go directly to the
quote surrounded by the original speech text. I'm hoping that people will use
this to reduce confusion and disagreement about what somebody meant when
discussing politics online.

The URL is <a title="Rock the Quote" href="http://rockthequote.com">http://rockthequote.com</a>.
